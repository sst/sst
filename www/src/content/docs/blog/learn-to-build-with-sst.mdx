We have a brand new tutorial that teaches you the basics of SST. And you can watch it as a video as well!

### New Tutorial

You can check out the new tutorial here — **docs.sst.dev/learn**

This new tutorial uses a GraphQL starter, to build a simple Reddit clone. We go through the workflow of adding a new feature.

In addition to covering the basics of SST, this tutorial sets you up with all the other tools and packages you need to build a full-stack serverless application.

So if you are just getting started with SST, or serverless, or you want to learn how to build full-stack applications; this tutorial is for you!

### Video Tutorial

We hosted a [livestream on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7xEKHWTKNk) where we worked through the tutorial and talked about it in detail.

This will help if you want to follow along with the tutorial as a video.
