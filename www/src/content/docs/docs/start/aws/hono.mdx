title: Hono on AWS with SST
description: Create and deploy a Hono API in AWS with SST.
---

There are two ways to deploy a [Hono](https://hono.dev) app to AWS with SST.

1. [Serverless](#serverless)
2. [Containers](#containers)

We'll use both to build a couple of simple apps below.

---

#### Examples

We also have a few other Hono examples that you can refer to.

- [Enabling streaming in your Hono app](/docs/examples/#aws-hono-streaming)

---

## Serverless

We are going to build a serverless Hono API, add an S3 Bucket for file uploads, and deploy it using a Lambda function.

:::tip[View source]
You can [view the source](https://github.com/sst/sst/tree/dev/examples/aws-hono) of this example in our repo.
:::

Before you get started, make sure to [configure your AWS credentials](/docs/iam-credentials#credentials).

---

### 1. Create a project

Let's start by creating our app.

```bash
mkdir aws-hono && cd aws-hono
npm init -y
```

##### Init SST

Now let's initialize SST in our app.

```bash
npx sst@latest init
npm install
```

Select the defaults and pick **AWS**. This'll create a `sst.config.ts` file in your project root.

---

### 2. Add an API

Let's add a Hono API using an AWS Lambda. Update your `sst.config.ts`.

```js title="sst.config.ts"
async run() {
  const hono = new sst.aws.Function("Hono", {
    url: true,
    handler: "index.handler",
  });

  return {
    api: hono.url,
  };
}
```

We are enabling the function URL for this.

---

##### Start dev mode

Start your app in dev mode. This runs your functions [_Live_](/docs/live/).

```bash
npx sst dev
```

This will give you the URL of your API.

```bash frame="none"
+  Complete
   api: https://gyrork2ll35rsuml2yr4lifuqu0tsjft.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws
```

---

### 3. Add an S3 Bucket

Let's add an S3 Bucket for file uploads. Update your `sst.config.ts`.

```js title="sst.config.ts"
const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");
```

##### Link the bucket

Now, link the bucket to the API.

```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3}
const hono = new sst.aws.Function("Hono", {
  url: true,
  link: [bucket],
  handler: "index.handler",
});
```

---

### 4. Upload a file

We want the `/` route of our API to generate a pre-signed URL to upload a file to our S3 Bucket. Create an `index.ts` file and add the following.

```ts title="index.ts" {5}
const app = new Hono()
  .get("/", async (c) => {
    const command = new PutObjectCommand({
      Key: crypto.randomUUID(),
      Bucket: Resource.MyBucket.name,
    });

    return c.text(await getSignedUrl(s3, command));
  });

export const handler = handle(app);
```

:::tip
We are directly accessing our S3 bucket with `Resource.MyBucket.name`.
:::

Install the npm packages.

```bash
npm install hono @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
```

Then add the relevant imports.

```ts title="index.ts"
import { Resource } from "sst";
import { getSignedUrl } from "@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner";
import {
  S3Client,
  GetObjectCommand,
  PutObjectCommand,
  ListObjectsV2Command,
} from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { handle } from "hono/aws-lambda";

const s3 = new S3Client({});
```


---

### 5. Download a file

We want the `/latest` route of our API to generate a pre-signed URL to download the last uploaded file in our S3 Bucket. Add this to your routes in `index.ts`.

```ts title="index.ts"
const app = new Hono()
  // ...
  .get("/latest", async (c) => {
    const objects = await s3.send(
      new ListObjectsV2Command({
        Bucket: Resource.MyBucket.name,
      }),
    );

    const latestFile = objects.Contents!.sort(
      (a, b) =>
        (b.LastModified?.getTime() ?? 0) - (a.LastModified?.getTime() ?? 0),
    )[0];

    const command = new GetObjectCommand({
      Key: latestFile.Key,
      Bucket: Resource.MyBucket.name,
    });

    return c.redirect(await getSignedUrl(s3, command));
  });
```

---

##### Test your app

Let's try uploading a file from your project root. Make sure to use your API URL.

```bash
curl --upload-file package.json "$(curl https://gyrork2ll35rsuml2yr4lifuqu0tsjft.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws)"
```

Now head over to `https://gyrork2ll35rsuml2yr4lifuqu0tsjft.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/latest` in your browser and it'll download the file you just uploaded.

---

### 6. Deploy your app

Now let's deploy your app.

```bash
npx sst deploy --stage production
```

You can use any stage name here but it's good to create a new stage for production.

---

## Containers

We are going to build a hit counter Hono API with Redis. We'll deploy it to AWS in a container using the `Cluster` component.

:::tip[View source]
You can [view the source](https://github.com/sst/sst/tree/dev/examples/aws-hono-container) of this example in our repo.
:::

Before you get started, make sure to [configure your AWS credentials](/docs/iam-credentials#credentials).

---

### 1. Create a project

Let's start by creating our app.

```bash
npm create hono@latest aws-hono-container
cd aws-hono-container
```

We are picking the **nodejs** template.

##### Init SST

Now let's initialize SST in our app.

```bash
npx sst@latest init
npm install
```

Select the defaults and pick **AWS**. This'll create a `sst.config.ts` file in your project root.

---

### 2. Add a Cluster

To deploy our Hono app in a container, we'll use [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) with [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/). Replace the `run` function in


```ts title="sst.config.ts" {9-11}
async run() {
  const vpc = new sst.aws.Vpc("MyVpc", { bastion: true });
  const cluster = new sst.aws.Cluster("MyCluster", { vpc });

  cluster.addService("MyService", {
    public: {
      ports: [{ listen: "80/http", forward: "3000/http" }],
    },
    dev: {
      command: "npm run dev",
    },
  });
}
```

This creates a VPC with a bastion host, an ECS Cluster, and adds a Fargate service to it.

:::note
By default, your service in not deployed when running in _dev_.
:::

The `dev.command` tells SST to instead run our Astro site locally in dev mode.

---

### 3. Add Redis

Let's add an [Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) Redis cluster. Add this below the `Vpc` component in your `sst.config.ts`.

```js title="sst.config.ts"
const redis = new sst.aws.Redis("MyRedis", { vpc });
```

This shares the same VPC as our ECS cluster.

---

#### Link Redis

Now, link the Redis cluster to the container.

```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3}
cluster.addService("MyService", {
  // ...
  link: [redis],
});
```

This will allow us to reference the Redis cluster in our Astro site.

---

#### Install a tunnel

Since our Redis cluster is in a VPC, we'll need a tunnel to connect to it from our local machine.

```bash "sudo"
sudo npx sst tunnel install
```

This needs _sudo_ to create a network interface on your machine. You'll only need to do this once on your machine.

---

#### Start dev mode

Start your app in dev mode.

```bash
npx sst dev
```

This will deploy your app, start a tunnel in the **Tunnel** tab, and run your Astro site locally in the **MyServiceDev** tab.

---

### 4. Connect to Redis

We want the `/` route to increment a counter in our Redis cluster. Let's start by installing the npm package we'll use.

```bash
npm install ioredis
```
---

## Connect the console

As a next step, you can setup the [SST Console](/docs/console/) to _**git push to deploy**_ your app and monitor it for any issues. 

![SST Console Autodeploy](../../../../../assets/docs/start/sst-console-autodeploy.png)

You can [create a free account](https://console.sst.dev) and connect it to your AWS account.
