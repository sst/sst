  table: table.name,
};
```

---
## FFmpeg in Lambda

Uses [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to process videos. In this example, it takes a `clip.mp4`
and grabs a single frame from it.

:::tip
You don't need to use a Lambda layer to use FFmpeg.
:::

We use the [`ffmpeg-static`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffmpeg-static) package that
contains pre-built binaries for all architectures.

```ts title="index.ts"
import ffmpeg from "ffmpeg-static";
```

We can use this to spawn a child process and run FFmpeg.

```ts title="index.ts"
spawnSync(ffmpeg, ffmpegParams, { stdio: "pipe" });
```

We don't need a layer when we deploy this because SST will use the right binary for the
target Lambda architecture; including `arm64`.

```json title="sst.config.ts"
{
  nodejs: { install: ["ffmpeg-static"] }
}
```

All this is handled by [`nodejs.install`](/docs/component/aws/function#nodejs-install).
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const func = new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
  url: true,
  memory: "2 GB",
  timeout: "15 minutes",
  handler: "index.handler",
  copyFiles: [{ from: "clip.mp4" }],
  nodejs: { install: ["ffmpeg-static"] },
});

return {
  url: func.url,
};
```

---
## IAM permissions boundaries

Use permissions boundaries to set the maximum permissions for all IAM roles that'll be
created in your app.

In this example, the Function has the `s3:ListAllMyBuckets` and `sqs:ListQueues`
permissions. However, we create a permissions boundary that only allows `s3:ListAllMyBuckets`.
And we apply it to all Roles in the app using the global
[`$transform`](/docs/reference/global/#transform).

As a result, the Function is only allowed to list S3 buckets. If you open the deployed URL,
you'll see that the SQS list call fails.

Learn more about [AWS IAM permissions boundaries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html).
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
// Create a permission boundary
const permissionsBoundary = new aws.iam.Policy("MyPermissionsBoundary", {
  policy: aws.iam.getPolicyDocumentOutput({
    statements: [
      {
        actions: ["s3:ListAllMyBuckets"],
        resources: ["*"],
      },
    ],
  }).json,
});

// Apply the boundary to all roles
$transform(aws.iam.Role, (args) => {
  args.permissionsBoundary = permissionsBoundary;
});

// The boundary automatically applies to this Function's role
const app = new sst.aws.Function("MyApp", {
  handler: "index.handler",
  permissions: [
    {
      actions: ["s3:ListAllMyBuckets", "sqs:ListQueues"],
      resources: ["*"],
    },
  ],
  url: true,
});

return {
  app: app.url,
};
```

## Current AWS account

You can use the `aws.getXXXXOutput()` provider functions to get info about the current
AWS account.
Learn more about [provider functions](/docs/providers/#functions).
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
return {
  region: aws.getRegionOutput().name,
  account: aws.getCallerIdentityOutput({}).accountId,
};
```

View the [full example](https://github.com/sst/ion/tree/dev/examples/aws-info).


---
## Kinesis streams

Create a Kinesis stream, and subscribe to it with a function.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const stream = new sst.aws.KinesisStream("MyStream");

// Create a function subscribing to all events
stream.subscribe("subscriber.all");

// Create a function subscribing to events of `bar` type
stream.subscribe("subscriber.filtered", {
  filters: [
    {
      data: {
        type: ["bar"],
      },
    },
  ],
});

const app = new sst.aws.Function("MyApp", {
  handler: "publisher.handler",
  link: [stream],
  url: true,
});

return {
  app: app.url,
  stream: stream.name,
};
```

View the [full example](https://github.com/sst/ion/tree/dev/examples/aws-kinesis-stream).


---
## AWS multi-region

To deploy resources to multiple AWS regions, you can create a new provider for the region
you want to deploy to.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const provider = new aws.Provider("MyProvider", { region: "us-west-2" });
```

And then pass that in to the resource.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", { handler: "index.handler" }, { provider });
```

If no provider is passed in, the default provider will be used. And if no region is
specified, the default region from your credentials will be used.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const east = new sst.aws.Function("MyEastFunction", {
  url: true,
  handler: "index.handler",
});

const provider = new aws.Provider("MyWestProvider", { region: "us-west-2" });
const west = new sst.aws.Function(
  "MyWestFunction",
  {
    url: true,
    handler: "index.handler",
  },
  { provider }
);

return {
  east: east.url,
  west: west.url,
};
```

---
## Prisma in Lambda

To use Prisma in a Lambda function you need:

1. [`@prisma/client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/client) package
2. The generated Prisma client from `npx prisma generate`

You don't need a layer to deploy these because `nodejs.install` automatically uses the
right binary for the target Lambda architecture.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
{
  nodejs: { install: ["@prisma/client"] }
}
```

However, this overwrites the default client in `node_modules/.prisma/client` that's generated
by Prisma. So we need to use a different directory.

```prisma title="prisma/schema.prisma"
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output = "../.prisma/client"
}
```

And then we need to copy the generated client to the function.

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
{
  copyFiles: [{
    from: ".prisma/client/"
  }]
}
```

We also need to import this client in the function.

```ts title="prisma.ts"
import { PrismaClient } from "./.prisma/client";
```

#### Prisma in serverless environments

Prisma unfortunately is [not great in serverless environments](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/databases-connections#serverless-environments-faas). For a couple of reasons:

1. It doesn't support Data API, so you need to manage the connection pool on your own.
2. Without the Data API, your functions need to run inside a VPC.
   - Lambdas inside VPCs are slower.
   - You cannot use `sst dev` without [connecting to the VPC](/docs/live#using-a-vpc).
3. Due to the internal architecture of their client, it's also has slower cold starts.

Instead we recommend using Drizzle. This example is here for reference for people that are
already using Prisma.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const vpc = new sst.aws.Vpc("MyVpc", { nat: "managed" });
const rds = new sst.aws.Postgres("MyPostgres", { vpc });

const api = new sst.aws.Function("MyApi", {
  vpc,
  url: true,
  link: [rds],
  handler: "index.handler",
  copyFiles: [{
    from: ".prisma/client/",
  }],
  nodejs: { install: ["@prisma/client"] },
});

return {
  api: api.url,
};
```

## Puppeteer in Lambda

To use Puppeteer in a Lambda function you need:

1. [`puppeteer-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-core)
2. Chromium
   - In `sst dev`, we'll use a locally installed Chromium version.
   - In `sst deploy`, we'll use the [`@sparticuz/chromium`](https://github.com/sparticuz/chromium) package. It comes with a pre-built binary for Lambda.

#### Chromium version

Since Puppeteer has a preferred version of Chromium, we'll need to check the version of
Chrome that a given version of Puppeteer supports. Head over to the
[Puppeteer's Chromium Support page](https://pptr.dev/chromium-support) and check which
versions work together.

For example, Puppeteer v23.1.1 supports Chrome for Testing 127.0.6533.119. So, we'll use the
v127 of `@sparticuz/chromium`.

```bash
npm install puppeteer-core@23.1.1 @sparticuz/chromium@127.0.0
```

#### Install Chromium locally

To use this locally, you'll need to install Chromium.

```bash
npx @puppeteer/browsers install chromium@latest --path /tmp/localChromium
```

Once installed you'll see the location of the Chromium binary, `/tmp/localChromium/chromium/mac_arm-1350406/chrome-mac/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium`.

Update this in your Lambda function.

```ts title="index.ts"
// This is the path to the local Chromium binary
const YOUR_LOCAL_CHROMIUM_PATH = "/tmp/localChromium/chromium/mac_arm-1350406/chrome-mac/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium";
```

You'll notice we are using the right binary with the `SST_DEV` environment variable.

```ts title="index.ts" {4-6}
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  args: chromium.args,
  defaultViewport: chromium.defaultViewport,
  executablePath: process.env.SST_DEV
    ? YOUR_LOCAL_CHROMIUM_PATH
    : await chromium.executablePath(),
  headless: chromium.headless,
});
```

#### Deploy

We don't need a layer to deploy this because `@sparticuz/chromium` comes with a pre-built
binary for Lambda.

:::note
As of writing this, `arm64` is not supported by `@sparticuz/chromium`.
:::

We just need to set it in the [`nodejs.install`](/docs/component/aws/function#nodejs-install).

```ts title="sst.config.ts"
{
  nodejs: {
    install: ["@sparticuz/chromium"]
  }
}
```

And on deploy, SST will use the right binary.

:::tip
You don't need to use a Lambda layer to use Puppeteer.
:::

We are giving our function more memory and a longer timeout since running Puppeteer can
take a while.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const api = new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
  url: true,
  memory: "2 GB",
  timeout: "15 minutes",
  handler: "index.handler",
  nodejs: {
    install: ["@sparticuz/chromium"],
  },
});

return {
  url: api.url,
};
```

## Subscribe to queues

Create an SQS queue, subscribe to it, and publish to it from a function.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const queue = new sst.aws.Queue("MyQueue");
queue.subscribe("subscriber.handler");

const app = new sst.aws.Function("MyApp", {
  handler: "publisher.handler",
  link: [queue],
  url: true,
});

return {
  app: app.url,
  queue: queue.url,
};
```

View the [full example](https://github.com/sst/ion/tree/dev/examples/aws-queue).


---
## Router and function URL

Creates a router that routes all requests to a function with a URL.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const api = new sst.aws.Function("MyApi", {
  handler: "api.handler",
  url: true,
});
const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket", {
  public: true,
});
const router = new sst.aws.Router("MyRouter", {
  domain: "router.ion.dev.sst.dev",
  routes: {
    "/api/*": api.url,
    "/*": $interpolate`https://${bucket.domain}`,
  },
});

return {
  router: router.url,
  bucket: bucket.domain,
};
```

---
## Sharp in Lambda

Uses the [Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) library to resize images. In this example,
it resizes a `logo.png` local file to 100x100 pixels.

```json title="sst.config.ts"
{
  nodejs: { install: ["sharp"] }
}
```

We don't need a layer to deploy this because `sharp` comes with a pre-built binary for Lambda.
This is handled by [`nodejs.install`](/docs/component/aws/function#nodejs-install).

:::tip
You don't need to use a Lambda layer to use Sharp.
:::

In dev, this uses the sharp npm package locally.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "dependencies": {
    "sharp": "^0.33.5"
  }
}
```

On deploy, SST will use the right binary from the sharp package for the target Lambda
architecture.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const func = new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
  url: true,
  handler: "index.handler",
  nodejs: { install: ["sharp"] },
  copyFiles: [{ from: "logo.png" }],
});

return {
  url: func.url,
};
```

## Vector search

Store and search for vector data using the Vector component. Includes a seeder API that
uses an LLM to generate embeddings for some movies and optionally their posters.

Once seeded, you can call the search API to query the vector database.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const OpenAiApiKey = new sst.Secret("OpenAiApiKey");
const vector = new sst.aws.Vector("MyVectorDB", {
  dimension: 1536,
});

const seeder = new sst.aws.Function("Seeder", {
  handler: "index.seeder",
  link: [OpenAiApiKey, vector],
  copyFiles: [
    { from: "iron-man.jpg", to: "iron-man.jpg" },
    {
      from: "black-widow.jpg",
      to: "black-widow.jpg",
    },
    {
      from: "spider-man.jpg",
      to: "spider-man.jpg",
    },
    { from: "thor.jpg", to: "thor.jpg" },
    {
      from: "captain-america.jpg",
      to: "captain-america.jpg",
    },
  ],
  url: true,
});

const app = new sst.aws.Function("MyApp", {
  handler: "index.app",
  link: [OpenAiApiKey, vector],
  url: true,
});

return { seeder: seeder.url, app: app.url };

## Cloudflare KV

This example creates a Cloudflare KV namespace and links it to a worker. Now you can use the
SDK to interact with the KV namespace in your worker.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const storage = new sst.cloudflare.Kv("MyStorage");
const worker = new sst.cloudflare.Worker("Worker", {
  url: true,
  link: [storage],
  handler: "index.ts",
});

return {
  url: worker.url,
};
```

---
## Link multiple secrets

You might have multiple secrets that need to be used across your app. It can be tedious to
create a new secret and link it to each function or resource.

A common pattern to addresses this is to create an object with all your secrets and then
link them all at once. Now when you have a new secret, you can add it to the object and
it will be automatically available to all your resources.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
// Manage all secrets together
const secrets = {
  secret1: new sst.Secret("Secret1", "some-secret-value-1"),
  secret2: new sst.Secret("Secret2", "some-secret-value-2"),
};
const allSecrets = Object.values(secrets);

const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");

const api = new sst.aws.Function("MyApi", {
  link: [bucket, ...allSecrets],
  handler: "index.handler",
  url: true,
});

return {
  url: api.url,
};
```

---
## Default function props

Set default props for all the functions in your app using the global [`$transform`](/docs/reference/global/#transform).
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
$transform(sst.aws.Function, (args) => {
  args.runtime = "nodejs14.x";
  args.environment = {
    FOO: "BAR",
  };
});
new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
  handler: "index.ts",
});
```

---
## Vercel domains

Creates a router that uses domains purchased through and hosted in your Vercel account.
Ensure the `VERCEL_API_TOKEN` and `VERCEL_TEAM_ID` environment variables are set.
```ts title="sst.config.ts"
const router = new sst.aws.Router("MyRouter", {
  domain: {
    name: "ion.sst.moe",
    dns: sst.vercel.dns({ domain: "sst.moe" }),
  },
  routes: {
    "/*": "https://sst.dev",
  },
});
return {
  router: router.url,
};
```
