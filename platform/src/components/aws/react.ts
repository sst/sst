   * }
   * ```
   *

   * ```js title="vite.config.ts" {3}
   * export default defineConfig({
   *   plugins: [tailwindcss(), reactRouter(), tsconfigPaths()],
   *   base: "/docs/"
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * And the `basename` in your React Router configuration.
   *
   * ```jsx title="react-router.config.ts" {2}
   * export const routerConfig = {
   *   basename: "/docs"
   * };
   * ```
   *
   * To serve your React app **from a subdomain**, you'll need to configure the
   * domain in your `Router` component to match both the root and the subdomain.
   *
   * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3,4}
   * const router = new sst.aws.Router("Router", {
   *   domain: {
   *     name: "example.com",
   *     aliases: ["*.example.com"]
   *   }
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * Now set the `domain` in the `router` prop.
   *
   * ```ts {4}
   * {
   *   router: {
   *     instance: router,
   *     domain: "docs.example.com"
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Finally, to serve your React app **from a combined pattern** like

   *     aliases: ["*.example.com"]
   *   }
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * And set the `domain` and the `path`.
   *
   * ```ts {4,5}
   * {
   *   router: {
   *     instance: router,
   *     domain: "dev.example.com",
