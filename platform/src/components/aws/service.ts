         * You **can not configure** both application and network layer protocols for the same
         * service.
         *
         * @example
         * Here we are listening on port `80` and forwarding it to the service on port `8080`.
         * ```js
         * {
         *   rules: [

         * }
         * ```
         *
         * The `forward` port and protocol defaults to the `listen` port and protocol. So in this
         * case both are `80/http`.
         *
         * ```js
         * {
         *   rules: [
         *     { listen: "80/http" }

         * ```
         *
         * If multiple containers are configured via the `containers` argument, you need to
         * specify which container the traffic should be forwarded to.
         *
         * ```js
         * {
         *   rules: [
         *     { listen: "80/http", container: "app" },
         *     { listen: "8000/http", container: "admin" }
         *   ]
         * }
         * ```
         *
         * You can also route the same port to multiple containers via path-based routing.
         *
         * ```js
         * {
         *   rules: [
         *     {
         *       listen: "80/http",
         *       container: "app",
         *       conditions: { path: "/api/*" }
         *     },
         *     {
         *       listen: "80/http",

         *     }
         *   ]
         * }
         * ```
         *
         * Additionally, you can redirect traffic from one port to another. This is

         * This health check is different from the [`health`](#health) check.
         * :::
         *
         * This health check is run by the load balancer. While, `health` is run by ECS. This
         * cannot be disabled if you are using a load balancer. While the other is off by default.
         *
         * Since this cannot be disabled, here are some tips on how to debug an unhealthy
         * health check.
         *
         * <details>
         * <summary>How to debug a load balancer health check</summary>
         *
         * If you notice a `Unhealthy: Health checks failed` error, it's because the health
         * check has failed. When it fails, the load balancer will terminate the containers,
         * causing any requests to fail.
         *
         * Here's how to debug it:
         *
         * 1. Verify the health check path.
         *
         *    By default, the load balancer checks the `/` path. Ensure it's accessible in your
         *    containers. If your application runs on a different path, then update the path in
         *    the health check config accordingly.
         *
         * 2. Confirm the containers are operational.
         *
         *    Navigate to **ECS console** > select the **cluster** > go to the **Tasks tab** >
         *    choose **Any desired status** under the **Filter desired status** dropdown > select
         *    a task and check for errors under the **Logs tab**. If it has error that means that
         *    the container failed to start.
         *
         * 3. If the container was terminated by the load balancer while still starting up, try
         *    increasing the health check interval and timeout.
         * </details>
         *
         * For `http` and `https` the default is:
         *
         * ```js
         * {
         *   path: "/",
         *   healthyThreshold: 5,
         *   successCodes: "200",
         *   timeout: "5 seconds",
         *   unhealthyThreshold: 2,
         *   interval: "30 seconds"
         * }
         * ```
         *
         * For `tcp` and `udp` the default is:
         *
         * ```js
         * {
         *   healthyThreshold: 5,
         *   timeout: "6 seconds",
         *   unhealthyThreshold: 2,
         *   interval: "30 seconds"
         * }
         * ```
         *
         * @example
         *
         * To configure the health check, we use the _port/protocol_ format. Here we are
         * configuring a health check that pings the `/health` path on port `8080`
         * every 10 seconds.
         *
         * ```js

   * Configure the capacity provider; regular Fargate or Fargate Spot, for this service.
   *
   * :::tip
   * Fargate Spot is a good option for dev or PR environments.
   * :::
   *
   * Fargate Spot allows you to run containers on spare AWS capacity at around 50% discount
   * compared to regular Fargate. [Learn more about Fargate
   * pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/pricing/).
   *
   * :::note
   * AWS might shut down Fargate Spot instances to reclaim capacity.
   * :::
   *
   * There are a couple of caveats:
   *
   * 1. AWS may reclaim this capacity and **turn off your service** after a two-minute warning.
   *    This is rare, but it can happen.
   * 2. If there's no spare capacity, you'll **get an error**.
   *
   * This makes Fargate Spot a good option for dev or PR environments. You can set this using.
   *
   * ```js
   * {
   *   capacity: "spot"
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * You can also configure the % of regular vs spot capacity you want through the `weight` prop.
   * And optionally set the `base` or first X number of tasks that'll be started using a given
   * capacity.
   *
   * For example, the `base: 1` says that the first task uses regular Fargate, and from that
   * point on there will be an even split between the capacity providers.
   *
   * ```js
   * {
   *   capacity: {
   *     fargate: { weight: 1, base: 1 },
   *     spot: { weight: 1 }
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * The `base` works in tandem with the `scaling` prop. So setting `base` to X doesn't mean
   * it'll start those tasks right away. It means that as your service scales up, according to
   * the `scaling` prop, it'll ensure that the first X tasks will be with the given capacity.
   *
   * :::caution
   * Changing `capacity` requires taking down and recreating the ECS service.
   * :::
   *
   * And this is why you can only set the `base` for only one capacity provider. So you
   * are not allowed to do the following.
   *
   * ```js
   * {
   *   capacity: {
   *     fargate: { weight: 1, base: 1 },
   *     // This will give you an error
   *     spot: { weight: 1, base: 1 }
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * When you change the `capacity`, the ECS service is terminated and recreated. This will
   * cause some temporary downtime.
   *
   * @default Regular Fargate
   *
   * @example
   *
   * Here are some examples settings.
   *
   * - Use only Fargate Spot.
   *
   *   ```js
   *   {
   *     capacity: "spot"
   *   }
   *   ```
   * - Use 50% regular Fargate and 50% Fargate Spot.
   *
   *   ```js
   *   {
   *     capacity: {
   *       fargate: { weight: 1 },
   *       spot: { weight: 1 }
   *     }
   *   }
   *   ```
   * - Use 50% regular Fargate and 50% Fargate Spot. And ensure that the first 2 tasks use
   *   regular Fargate.
   *
   *   ```js
   *   {
   *     capacity: {
   *       fargate: { weight: 1, base: 2 },

/**
 * The `Service` component lets you create containers that are always running, like web or
 * application servers. It uses [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) on [AWS Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html).
 *
 * @example
 *
 * #### Create a Service
 *
 * Services are run inside an ECS Cluster. If you haven't already, create one.
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 * const vpc = new sst.aws.Vpc("MyVpc");
 * const cluster = new sst.aws.Cluster("MyCluster", { vpc });
 * ```
 *
 * Add the service to it.
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 * const service = new sst.aws.Service("MyService", { cluster });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Configure the container image
 *
 * By default, the service will look for a Dockerfile in the root directory. Optionally
 * configure the image context and dockerfile.
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Service("MyService", {
 *   cluster,
 *   image: {
 *     context: "./app",
 *     dockerfile: "Dockerfile"
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * To add multiple containers in the service, pass in an array of containers args.
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Service("MyService", {
 *   cluster,
 *   containers: [
 *     {
 *       name: "app",
 *       image: "nginxdemos/hello:plain-text"
 *     },
 *     {
 *       name: "admin",
 *       image: {
 *         context: "./admin",
 *         dockerfile: "Dockerfile"
 *       }
 *     }
 *   ]
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * This is useful for running sidecar containers.
 *
 * #### Enable auto-scaling
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Service("MyService", {
 *   cluster,
 *   scaling: {
 *     min: 4,
 *     max: 16,
 *     cpuUtilization: 50,
 *     memoryUtilization: 50
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Expose through API Gateway
 *
 * You can give your service a public URL by exposing it through API Gateway HTTP API. You can
 * also optionally give it a custom domain.
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 * const service = new sst.aws.Service("MyService", {
 *   cluster,
 *   serviceRegistry: {
 *     port: 80
 *   }
 * });
 *
 * const api = new sst.aws.ApiGatewayV2("MyApi", {
 *   vpc,
 *   domain: "example.com"
 * });
 * api.routePrivate("$default", service.nodes.cloudmapService.arn);
 * ```
 *
 * #### Add a load balancer
 *
 * You can also expose your service by adding a load balancer to it and optionally
 * adding a custom domain.
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Service("MyService", {
 *   cluster,
 *   loadBalancer: {
 *     domain: "example.com",
 *     rules: [
 *       { listen: "80/http" },
 *       { listen: "443/https", forward: "80/http" }
 *     ]
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Link resources
 *
 * [Link resources](/docs/linking/) to your service. This will grant permissions
 * to the resources and allow you to access it in your app.
 *
 * ```ts {5} title="sst.config.ts"
 * const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");
 *
 * new sst.aws.Service("MyService", {
 *   cluster,
 *   link: [bucket]
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * You can use the [SDK](/docs/reference/sdk/) to access the linked resources in your service.
 *
 * ```ts title="app.ts"
 * import { Resource } from "sst";
 *
 * console.log(Resource.MyBucket.name);
 * ```
 *
 * #### Service discovery
 *
 * This component automatically creates a Cloud Map service host name for the
 * service. So anything in the same VPC can access it using the service's host name.
 *
 * For example, if you link the service to a Lambda function that's in the same VPC.
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {2,4}
 * new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
 *   vpc,
 *   url: true,
 *   link: [service],
 *   handler: "lambda.handler"
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * You can access the service by its host name using the [SDK](/docs/reference/sdk/).
 *
 * ```ts title="lambda.ts"
 * import { Resource } from "sst";
 *
 * await fetch(`http://${Resource.MyService.service}`);
 * ```
 *
 * [Check out an example](/docs/examples/#aws-cluster-service-discovery).

 *
 * ### Cost
 *
 * By default, this uses a _Linux/X86_ _Fargate_ container with 0.25 vCPUs at $0.04048 per
 * vCPU per hour and 0.5 GB of memory at $0.004445 per GB per hour. It includes 20GB of
 * _Ephemeral Storage_ for free with additional storage at $0.000111 per GB per hour. Each
 * container also gets a public IPv4 address at $0.005 per hour.
 *
 * It works out to $0.04048 x 0.25 x 24 x 30 + $0.004445 x 0.5 x 24 x 30 + $0.005
 * x 24 x 30 or **$12 per month**.

 * If you are using all Fargate Spot instances with `capacity: "spot"`, it's $0.01218784 x 0.25
 * x 24 x 30 + $0.00133831 x 0.5 x 24 x 30 + $0.005 x 24 x 30 or **$6 per month**
 *
 * Adjust this for the `cpu`, `memory` and `storage` you are using. And
 * check the prices for _Linux/ARM_ if you are using `arm64` as your `architecture`.
 *
 * The above are rough estimates for _us-east-1_, check out the
 * [Fargate pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/pricing/) and the
 * [Public IPv4 Address pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/) for more details.
 *
 * #### Scaling
 *
 * By default, `scaling` is disabled. If enabled, adjust the above for the number of containers.
 *
 * #### API Gateway
 *
 * If you expose your service through API Gateway, you'll need to add the cost of
 * [API Gateway HTTP API](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/pricing/#HTTP_APIs) as well.
 * For services that don't get a lot of traffic, this ends up being a lot cheaper since API
 * Gateway is pay per request.
 *
 * Learn more about using
 * [Cluster with API Gateway](/docs/examples/#aws-cluster-with-api-gateway).
 *
 * #### Application Load Balancer
 *
 * If you add `loadBalancer` _HTTP_ or _HTTPS_ `rules`, an ALB is created at $0.0225 per hour,
 * $0.008 per LCU-hour, and $0.005 per hour if HTTPS with a custom domain is used. Where LCU
 * is a measure of how much traffic is processed.
 *
 * That works out to $0.0225 x 24 x 30 or **$16 per month**. Add $0.005 x 24 x 30 or **$4 per
 * month** for HTTPS. Also add the LCU-hour used.
 *
 * The above are rough estimates for _us-east-1_, check out the
 * [Application Load Balancer pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/pricing/)
 * for more details.
 *
 * #### Network Load Balancer
 *
 * If you add `loadBalancer` _TCP_, _UDP_, or _TLS_ `rules`, an NLB is created at $0.0225 per hour and
 * $0.006 per NLCU-hour. Where NCLU is a measure of how much traffic is processed.
 *
 * That works out to $0.0225 x 24 x 30 or **$16 per month**. Also add the NLCU-hour used.
 *
 * The above are rough estimates for _us-east-1_, check out the
 * [Network Load Balancer pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/pricing/)
 * for more details.
