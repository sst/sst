   *
   * - A path like `/docs`
   * - A subdomain like `docs.example.com`
   * - Or a combined pattern like `dev.example.com/docs`
   *
   * @example
   *
   * To serve your Astro site **from a path**, you'll need to configure the root domain
   * in your `Router` component.
   *
   * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {2}

   * ```
   *
   * You also need to set the
   * [`base`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base)
   * in your `astro.config.mjs`.
   *
   * :::caution
   * If routing to a path, you need to set that as the base path in your Astro
   * site as well.
   * :::
   *
   * ```js title="astro.config.mjs" {3}
   * export default defineConfig({
   *   adapter: sst(),
   *   base: "/docs"
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * To serve your Astro site **from a subdomain**, you'll need to configure the
   * domain in your `Router` component to match both the root and the subdomain.
   *
   * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3,4}
   * const router = new sst.aws.Router("Router", {
   *   domain: {
   *     name: "example.com",
   *     aliases: ["*.example.com"]

   *
   * ```ts {4}
   * {
   *   router: {
   *     instance: router,
   *     domain: "docs.example.com"
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Finally, to serve your Astro site **from a combined pattern** like
   * `dev.example.com/docs`, you'll need to configure the domain in your `Router` to
   * match the subdomain.
   *
   * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3,4}

 *
 * #### Change the path

 *
 * ```js {2} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Astro("MyWeb", {

 * const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");

 * new sst.aws.Astro("MyWeb", {
