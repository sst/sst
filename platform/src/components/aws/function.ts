   *
   * Where `packages/functions/src` is the path. And `main` is the file, where you might have
   * a `main.ts` or `main.js`. And `handler` is the method exported in that file.

   * :::note

   * ```js
   * {
   *   bundle: "packages/functions/src",
   *   handler: "index.handler"
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * ##### Python
   *
   * SST uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to package the function.
   * You need to have it installed.
   *
   * :::note
   * You need uv installed for Python functions.
   * :::
   *
   * Your handler must live in a [uv workspace](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/workspaces/)
   * with a `pyproject.toml`. Match the Python version to your Lambda runtime.
   *
   * ```toml title="pyproject.toml"
   * [project]
   * name = "my-project"
   * requires-python = "==3.11.*"
   * ```
   *
   * Install your packages before starting `sst dev`:
   *
   * ```bash
   * uv sync --all-packages
   * ```
   *
   * Use absolute imports within your package.
   *
   * ```python
   * from mypackage.utils import helper
   * ```
   *
   * Avoid relative imports — they can fail in Lambda. Make sure package directories have `__init__.py`.
   *
   * Access static files relative to `__file__`.
   *
   * ```python
   * from pathlib import Path
   * config = Path(__file__).parent / "config.json"
   * ```
   *
   * For large dependencies like numpy or pandas, deploy as a container. See [`python.container`](#python-container).
   *
   * For common project layouts, check out the [Python examples](https://github.com/sst/sst/tree/dev/examples/python-layouts).
   *
   * ##### Golang
   *
   * For Golang the handler looks like.
   *
   * ```js
   * {
   *   handler: "packages/functions/go/some_module"
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Where `packages/functions/go/some_module` is the path to the Go module. This
   * includes the name of the module in your `go.mod`. So in this case your `go.mod`
   * might be in `packages/functions/go` and `some_module` is the name of the
   * module.
   *
   * You can refer to [this example of deploying a Go function](/docs/examples/#aws-lambda-go).
   *
   * ##### Rust
   *
   * For Rust, the handler looks like.
   *
   * ```js
   * {
   *   handler: "crates/api"
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Where `crates/api` is the path to the Rust crate. This means there is a
   * `Cargo.toml` file in `crates/api`, and the main() function handles the lambda.

 * are community supported. Other runtimes are on the roadmap.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * #### Minimal example
 *
 *
 * <Tabs>
 *   <TabItem label="Node">
 *   Pass in the path to your handler function.
 *
 *   ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 *   new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
 *     handler: "src/lambda.handler"
 *   });
 *   ```
 *
 *   [Learn more below](#handler).

 *   new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
 *     runtime: "python3.13",
 *     handler: "functions/src/functions/api.handler"
 *   });
 *   ```
 *
 *   You need to have uv installed and your handler function needs to be in a uv workspace. [Learn more below](#handler).
 *   </TabItem>
 *   <TabItem label="Go">
 *   Pass in the directory to your Go module.
 *
 *   ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 *   new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
 *     runtime: "go",
 *     handler: "./src"
 *   });

 *     handler: "./crates/api/"
 *   });
 *   ```
 *
 *   [Learn more below](#handler).
 *   </TabItem>
 * </Tabs>
 *
 * #### Set additional config
 *
 * Pass in additional Lambda config.
 *
 * ```ts {3,4} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
 *   handler: "src/lambda.handler",
 *   timeout: "3 minutes",
 *   memory: "1024 MB"
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Link resources
 *
 * [Link resources](/docs/linking/) to the function. This will grant permissions
 * to the resources and allow you to access it in your handler.
 *
 * ```ts {5} title="sst.config.ts"
 * const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");
 *
 * new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
 *   handler: "src/lambda.handler",
 *   link: [bucket]

 * You can use the [SDK](/docs/reference/sdk/) to access the linked resources
 * in your handler.
 *
 * <Tabs>
 *   <TabItem label="Node">
 *   ```ts title="src/lambda.ts"

 *
 *   let resource = Resource::init().unwrap();
 *   let Bucket { name } = resource.get("Bucket").unwrap();
 *   ```
 *   </TabItem>
 * </Tabs>
 *
 * #### Set environment variables
 *
 * Set environment variables that you can read in your function. For example, using
 * `process.env` in your Node.js functions.
 *
 * ```ts {4} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
 *   handler: "src/lambda.handler",
 *   environment: {
 *     DEBUG: "true"
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Enable function URLs
 *
 * Enable function URLs to invoke the function over HTTP.
 *
 * ```ts {3} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
 *   handler: "src/lambda.handler",
 *   url: true
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Bundling
 *
 * Customize how SST uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) to bundle your Node.js
 * functions with the `nodejs` property.
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3-5}
 * new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
 *   handler: "src/lambda.handler",
 *   nodejs: {
 *     install: ["pg"]
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Or override it entirely by passing in your own function `bundle`.
