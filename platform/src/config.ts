/**
 * The `sst.config.ts` file is used to configure your SST app and its resources.
 *
 * ```ts
 * $config(input: Config): Config
 * ```
 *
 * You specify it using the `$config` function. This takes an object of type [`Config`](#config).
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 * /// <reference path="./.sst/platform/config.d.ts" />
 *
 * export default $config({
 *   // Your app's config
 *   app(input) {
 *     return {
 *       name: "my-sst-app",
 *       home: "aws"
 *     };
 *   },
 *   // Your app's resources
 *   async run() {
 *     const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");
 *
 *     // Your app's outputs
 *     return {
 *       bucket: bucket.name
 *     };
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The `Config` object takes two functions:
 * 1. [`app`](#app-2) — Your config
 * 2. [`run`](#run) — Your resources
 *
 * The `app` function is evaluated right when your app loads. It's used to define the app config and its providers.
 *
 * :::note
 * You need TypeScript 5 to see the types in your config.
 * :::
 *
 * You can add Pulumi code in the `run` function not the `app` function. While the `run`
 * function is where you define your resources using SST or Pulumi's components.
 *
 * The run function also has access to a list of [Global](/docs/reference/global/) `$` variables and functions. These serve as the context for your app config.
 *
 * :::caution
 * Do not `import` the provider packages in your `sst.config.ts`.
 * :::
 *
 * Since SST manages importing your provider packages, it's recommended not to add any imports
 * in your `sst.config.ts`.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * #### .env
 *
 * Your `.env` and `.env.<stage>` files are loaded as environment variables in your config.
 * They need to be in the same directory as your `sst.config.ts`.
 *
 * ```bash title=".env"
 * MY_ENV_VAR=hello
 * ```
 *
 * And are available as `process.env` in both your `app` and `run` functions.
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 * process.env.MY_ENV_VAR
 * ```
 *
 * The `.env` file takes precedence over `.env.<stage>`. So if you have a `.env` and a
 * `.env.dev` file, the values in the `.env` file will be used.
 *
 * :::note
 * You need to restart `sst dev` for changes in your `.env` files to take effect.
 * :::
 *
 * Make sure the stage name in your `.env.<stage>` matches the stage your app is running on.

       * example, to skip any deploys to the `staging` stage.
       *
       * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {2}
       * target(event) {
       *   if (event.type === "branch" && event.branch === "staging") return;
       *   if (event.type === "branch" && event.branch === "main" && event.action === "pushed") {
       *     return { stage: "production" };
       *   }
       * }
       * ```
       *
       * The stage that is returned is then compared to the environments set in the
       * [app settings in the Console](/docs/console/#setup). If the stage matches a deployment
       * target, the stage will be deployed to that environment. If no matching environment is
       * found, the deploy will be skipped.
       *
       * :::note
       * If a target is not returned, the app will not be deployed.
       * :::
       *
       * In addition to the `stage` you can also configure the `runner` that will run the build.
       * For example, to use a larger machine for the `production` stage.
       *
       * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
       * target(event) {
       *   if (event.type === "branch" && event.branch === "main" && event.action === "pushed") {
       *     return {
       *       stage: "production"
       *       runner: {
       *         engine: "codebuild",
       *         compute: "large"
       *       };
       *     };
       *   }
       * }
       * ```

   * An async function that lets you define the resources in your app.
   *
   * :::note
   * You can use SST and Pulumi components only in the `run` function.
   * :::
   *
   * You can optionally return an object that'll be displayed as the output in the CLI.
   *
   * @example
   *
   * For example, here we return the name of the bucket we created.
   *
   * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
   * async run() {
   *   const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");
   *
   *   return {
   *     bucket: bucket.name
   *   };
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * This will display the following in the CLI on `sst deploy` and `sst dev`.
   *
   * ```bash frame=\"none\"
   * bucket: bucket-jOaikGu4rla
   * ```
   *
   * These outputs are also written to a `.sst/output.json` file after every successful deploy.
   * It contains the above outputs in JSON.
   *
   * ```json title=".sst/output.json"
   * {"bucket": "bucket-jOaikGu4rla"}
   * ```
