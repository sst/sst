/**
 * The `sst.config.ts` file is used to configure your SST app and its resources.
 *
 * ```ts
 * $config(input: Config): Config
 * ```
 *
 * You specify it using the `$config` function. This takes an object of type [`Config`](#config).
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 * /// <reference path="./.sst/platform/config.d.ts" />
 *
 * export default $config({
 *   // Your app's config
 *   app(input) {
 *     return {
 *       name: "my-sst-app",
 *       home: "aws"
 *     };
 *   },
 *   // Your app's resources
 *   async run() {
 *     const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");
 *
 *     // Your app's outputs
 *     return {
 *       bucket: bucket.name
 *     };
 *   },
 *   // Optionally, your app's Console config
 *   console: {
 *     autodeploy: {
 *       runner: { compute: "large" }
 *     }
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The `Config` object takes:
 * 1. [`app`](#app-2) — Your config
 * 2. [`run`](#run) — Your resources
 * 3. [`console`](#console) — Optionally, your app's Console config
 *
 * The `app` function is evaluated right when your app loads. It's used to define the app config and its providers.
 *
 * :::note
 * You need TypeScript 5 to see the types in your config.
 * :::
 *
 * You can add Pulumi code in the `run` function not the `app` function. While the `run`
 * function is where you define your resources using SST or Pulumi's components.
 *
 * The run function also has access to a list of [Global](/docs/reference/global/) `$` variables and functions. These serve as the context for your app config.
 *
 * :::caution
 * Do not `import` the provider packages in your `sst.config.ts`.
 * :::
 *
 * Since SST manages importing your provider packages, it's recommended not to add any imports
 * in your `sst.config.ts`.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * #### .env
 *
 * Your `.env` and `.env.<stage>` files are loaded as environment variables in your config.
 * They need to be in the same directory as your `sst.config.ts`.
 *
 * ```bash title=".env"
 * MY_ENV_VAR=hello
 * ```
 *
 * And are available as `process.env` in both your `app` and `run` functions.
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 * process.env.MY_ENV_VAR
 * ```
 *
 * The `.env` file takes precedence over `.env.<stage>`. So if you have a `.env` and a
 * `.env.dev` file, the values in the `.env` file will be used.
 *
 * :::note
 * You need to restart `sst dev` for changes in your `.env` files to take effect.
 * :::
 *
 * Make sure the stage name in your `.env.<stage>` matches the stage your app is running on.

     * Auto-deploys your app when you _git push_ to your repo. Uses
     * [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) in your account to run the build.
     *
     * To get started, first [make sure to set up Autodeploy](/docs/console#setup).
     * Specifically, you need to configure an environment with the stage and AWS account
     * you want to auto-deploy to.
     *
     * Now when you _git push_ to a branch, pull request, or tag, the following happens:
     *
     * 1. The stage name is generated based on the `autodeploy.target` callback.
     *    1. If there is no callback, the stage name is a sanitized version of the branch or tag.
     *    2. If there is a callback but no stage is returned, the deploy is skipped.
     * 2. The runner config is generated based on the `autodeploy.runner`. Or the defaults are
     *    used.
     * 3. The stage is matched against the environments in the Console to get the AWS account
     *    and any environment variables for the deploy.
     * 4. The deploy is run based on the above config.
     *
     * This only applies only to git events. If you trigger a deploy through the Console, you
     * are asked to sepcify the stage you want to deploy to. So in this case, it skips step 1
     * from above and does not call `autodeploy.target`.
     *
     * You can further configure Autodeploy through the `autodeploy` prop.
     *
     * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
     * console: {
     *   autodeploy: {
     *     target(event) {}, // Customize the target stage
     *     runner(stage) {}, // Customize the runner
     *     async workflow({ $, input }) {} // Customize the workflow
     *   }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * Here, `target`, `runner`, and `workflow` are all optional and come with defaults, so
     * you don't need to configure anything. But you can customize them.
     *
     * ```ts
     * {
     *   autodeploy: {
     *     target(event) {
     *       if (
     *         event.type === "branch" &&
     *         event.branch === "main" &&
     *         event.action === "pushed"
     *        ) {
     *         return { stage: "production" };
     *       }
     *     },
     *     runner(stage) {
     *       if (stage === "production") return { timeout: "3 hours" };
     *     }
     *   }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * For example, here we are only auto-deploying to the `production` stage when you git push
     * to the `main` branch. We are also setting the timeout to 3 hours for the `production`
     * stage. You can read more about the `target` and `runner` props below.
     *
     * Finally, if you want to configure exactly what happens in the build, you can pass in
     * a `workflow` function.
     *
     * ```ts
     * {
     *   autodeploy: {
     *     async workflow({ $, event }) {
     *       await $`npm i -g pnpm`;
     *       await $`pnpm i`;
     *       event.action === "removed"
     *         ? await $`pnpm sst remove`
     *         : await $`pnpm sst deploy`;
     *     }
     *   }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * You can read more the `workflow` prop below.

       * supported.
       *
       * :::tip
       * This is not called when you manually trigger a deploy through the Console.
       * :::
       *
       * This config only applies to git events. If you trigger a deploy through the Console,
       * you are asked to sepcify the stage you want to deploy to. In this case, and
       * when you redeploy a manual deploy, the `target` function is not called.
       *
       * By default, this is what the `target` function looks like:
       *
       * ```ts
       * {
       *   target(event) {
       *     if (event.type === "branch" && event.action === "pushed") {
       *       return {
       *         stage: event.branch
       *           .replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9-]/g, "-")
       *           .replace(/-+/g, "-")
       *           .replace(/^-/g, "")
       *           .replace(/-$/g, "")
       *       };
       *     }
       *
       *     if (event.type === "pull_request") {
       *       return { stage: `pr-${event.number}` };
       *     }
       *   }
       * }
       * ```
       *
       * So for a:
       *
       * - **branch**: The stage name is a sanitized version of the branch name. When a branch
       *   is removed, the stage is **not removed**.
       * - **pull request**: The stage name is `pr-<number>`. When a pull request is closed,
       *   the stage **is removed**.
       *
       * :::tip
       * Git events to tags are not auto-deployed by default.
       * :::
       *
       * Git events to tags are not auto-deployed by default. You can change this by adding it
       * to your config.
       *
       * ```ts
       * {
       *   target(event) {
       *     if (event.type === "tag" && event.action === "pushed") {
       *       return {

       * The workflow function is run inside a Bun process. It passes in `$`
       * as the [Bun Shell](https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/shell). This makes
       * _bash-like_ scripting easier.
       *
       * :::tip
       * Use the Bun Shell to make running commands easier.
       * :::
       *
       * For example, here's how you can run tests before deploying.
       *
       * ```ts {5}
       * {
       *   async workflow({ $, event }) {
       *     await $`npm i -g pnpm`;
       *     await $`pnpm i`;
       *     await $`pnpm test`;
       *     event.action === "removed"
       *       ? await $`pnpm sst remove`
       *       : await $`pnpm sst deploy`;
       *   }
       * }
       * ```
       *
       * When you pass in a `workflow`, you are effectively taking control of what
       * runs in your build.
       *
       * :::caution
       * If you don't run `sst deploy`, your app won't be deployed.
       * :::
       *
       * This means that if you don't run `sst deploy`, your app won't be deployed.
       *
       * :::tip
       * Throwing an error will fail the build and display the error in the Console.
       * :::
       *
       * If you throw an error in the workflow, the deploy will fail and the error
       * will be displayed in the Autodeploy logs.
       *
       * Here's a more detailed example of using the Bun Shell to handle failures.
       *
       * ```ts {6,9}
       * {
       *   async workflow({ $, event }) {
       *     await $`npm i -g pnpm`;
       *     await $`pnpm i`;
       *
       *     const { exitCode } = await $`pnpm test`.nothrow();
       *     if (exitCode !== 0) {
       *       // Process the test report and then fail the build
       *       throw new Error("Failed to run tests");
       *     }
       *
       *     event.action === "removed"
       *       ? await $`pnpm sst remove`
       *       : await $`pnpm sst deploy`;
       *   }
       * }
       * ```
       *
       * You'll notice we are not passing in `--stage` to the SST commands. This is because the `SST_STAGE` environment variable is already set in
       * the build process.
       *
       * :::tip
       * You don't need to pass in `--stage` to the SST commands.

  /**
   * Configure hooks that run at specific points during operations.
   *
   * Currently supports a `deploy.after` hook that runs after a deployment completes.
   * This is useful for sending notifications (like Slack), triggering follow-up actions,
   * or logging deployment results.
   *
   * :::note
   * The hook runs after `sst deploy` completes, not during `sst dev` or `sst diff`.
   * :::
   *
   * :::caution
   * The hook will not run if the deployment is interrupted (e.g., Ctrl+C).
   * :::
   *
   * :::caution
   * Hook errors will cause the deployment to fail. If you want to handle errors
   * gracefully and prevent deployment failure, wrap your hook logic in a try-catch block.
   * :::
   *
   * @example
   *
   * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
   * hooks: {
   *   deploy: {
   *     async after(result) {
   *       // Send a notification to your webhook
   *       await fetch("https://example.com/webhook", {
   *         method: "POST",
   *         body: JSON.stringify({
   *           text: `Deployed ${result.app.name} to ${result.app.stage}`
   *         })
   *       });
   *     }
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * The `after` hook receives a `DeployResult` object containing:
   * - `success` — Whether the deployment completed without errors
   * - `errors` — Array of errors if any occurred
   * - `outputs` — The outputs from your `run` function
   * - `resources` — Number of resources in the stack
   * - `app.name` — The app name
   * - `app.stage` — The stage name
   *
   * #### Timeout
   *
   * By default, the hook has a 30-second timeout. You can customize this by setting
   * the `SST_HOOK_TIMEOUT` environment variable to the number of seconds.
   *
   * ```bash
   * SST_HOOK_TIMEOUT=60 sst deploy
   * ```
   *
   * This sets the timeout to 60 seconds.
